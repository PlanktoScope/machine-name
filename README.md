# machine-name
A tool for mapping serial numbers to language-localized names

## Introduction

Devices often assign a (pseudo-)unique serial number to each unit. However, each device may also need a (pseudo-) unique human-readable name for easy access, e.g. to network services. This package provides a one-to-one mapping between serial numbers (within a finite range) and Heroku-style names (i.e. two simple words followed by a short number, such as `friendly-cat-4827`). The names are constructed from word lists within a specific locale, so that the language used for the name can be localized.
