For English names, the first word in the name is a predicate and the second word in the name is a noun. All words are filtered down into relatively simple English.

## Predicates

Words in the following lists are candidates for predicates:

- `glitch-friendly-words-predicates.txt`: from [v1.2.0](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words/commit/17f4219dbc88e0fa9cdbfa661a436a71a96906e5) of the MIT-licensed project https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words

## Objects

Words in the following lists are candidates for predicates:

- `glitch-friendly-words-*.txt`: from [v1.2.0](https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words/commit/17f4219dbc88e0fa9cdbfa661a436a71a96906e5) of the MIT-licensed project https://github.com/glitchdotcom/friendly-words

## Filters

The same set of filters is used for both predicates and objects. Only words found in at least one of any of the following lists are allowed by the filters:
